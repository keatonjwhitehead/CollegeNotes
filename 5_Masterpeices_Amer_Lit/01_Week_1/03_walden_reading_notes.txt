Chapter 1 Economy
     Lived alone and out of human contact for two years and two months... Why?

     Quote 1:
          "We commonly   do  not  remember   that   it   is,   after   all,   always
           the  first person  that  is   speaking.  I  should  not talk   so   much
           about  myself   if there were any body else whom I knew as well. Unfortunately,
           I am confined   to   this   theme   by  the  narrowness   of   my   experience.
           Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple
           and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard
           of other menâ€™s lives; some such account as he would send to his kindred
           from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely, it must have been
           in a distant land to me. Perhaps these pages are more particularly addressed
           to poor students. As for the rest of my readers, they will accept such
           portions as apply to them. I trust that none will stretch the seams in
           putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits."
