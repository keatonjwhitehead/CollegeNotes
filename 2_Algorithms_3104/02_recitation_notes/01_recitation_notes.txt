Analyze Algorithms
     We informally sweep a lot under the rug
          We try to simplify things
          Basic (atomic) operations take O(1) time
          All higher oder operations consist of (possibly many) basic operations
          Basic (atomic) data types take O(1) space
          All higher oder data types consist of many basic data types
Counting operations
     Look out for assignments and returns

Induction
     A way to prove that something is true for all n, which we encounter ofeent in alogithms
     Needs three things:

Strong vs. Weak Induction

Proof by Contradiction

Proof by Counterexample
