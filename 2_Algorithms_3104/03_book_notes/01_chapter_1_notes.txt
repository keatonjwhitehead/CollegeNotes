Chapter 1: overview of algorithms and their place in modern computing systems. This
          Chapter defines what an algorithm is and lists some examples. It also
          makes a case that algorithms are a technology, just as are fast hardware,
          graphical user interfaces, object-oriented systems, and networks.
