I chose to do the Rolling Stoneâ€™s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time dataset. For my first visualization, I sorted the data by years on the x-axis and number of records on the Rolling Stone's list on the y-axis. The color coordination was to distinguish the different genres of music, this graph can be used to look at what year each genre was most popular. This can be helpful for understanding culture during different time periods. I found it interesting that the throughout the years Rock, although it is decreasing it still typically had the most albums on the list each year. Now, this can also lead one to believe that their music was very alive, and well written around 1963 as seen by the massive spike. Could this be because of the quality of music, or the judges taste in music?

For the second graph, I wanted to see if there were any artists that had multiple albums on this list. So I set a filter to only show the artists that had 5 or more albums that made the list. It was interesting to see that the Beatles had 11 listings but all of them were around 1963. That can be correlated to the previous graph as to why there are so many rock albums around the same time. What was also interesting was this was the only time period where the Beatles had albums that made the list. Whereas Bob Dylan made the list 11 times as well but over a longer period of time. This can be helpful but there are many factors behind the scenes that could play a part that is not clear here. For example, the Beatles haven't made any more albums because they broke up in 1970 so their contribution to the recent years is not relevant.

For this graph, I had the artist listed on the y-axis and the number of albums on the x-axis.
