Questions:
     How well are students (all, subgroups) "retained" year to year in their major?
          Are  there differences across majors or CIP codes? Across demographic variables?
          Are there differences in retention depending on when students declare their major?
          Are there differences across institutional tupe? Between "Extension Services" clients
          and general "Academic Alliance" members?

     What is the differences between students who apply, are accepted, and actually enroll?
     How does this vary across <all of the above>?
     What questions do you think make sense?
