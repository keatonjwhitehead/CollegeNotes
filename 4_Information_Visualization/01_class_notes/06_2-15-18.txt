////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Discussion:
     Algebra
          visuals are invertible
          People are flawed
          "Recipe" accounting for subjectivity

     Aesthetics
          Artistic freedom
          SW, Data, speed skill
          Subjective
          How people interact
          Less about a math problem and more about how do we move forward

     Matrices
          Tangible excel
          Use computer to extend capability
          Grouping/similarity
          Conscious target

     Bertin

Items:
     A discrete thing (data point). May have multiple attributes

Attributes:
     Something that can be measured, observed or logged. A variable or dimension

Link:
     A relationship between items(think networks!)

Position:
     A spatial property of the data

Grid:
     Method of sampling data based on other properties of the data(position or attributes)
     Generally not going to visualize grid data specifically
     Why might we use a grid?
          Common use of scientific visualization:
               Vector flow over a car.

Semantics
     All data represents something
     We call the stuff that tells us what means/represents semantics
     11,7 -> months, time, population, age

Semantics are important because
     They ell us what matters about our Data

Death and mortality picture
     Not for providing data to viewer just trying to prove a point


Dataset types
     Tables
          contain rows and columns
          Cells contain values that represent an attribute for a given item
          Keys are important attributes of each item
          CSVs & Databases

     Dataset Types
          Networks express links between different nodes
          Both nodes and links may have attributes
          Depicted as node-like diagrams, but don't have to
