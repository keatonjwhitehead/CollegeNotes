Information Visualization
Class Notes
/////////////////////////////


     Pie charts
          ~only good for proportions, do not use otherwise

     Heat map
          ~Map each data point to a color
          ~Good at estimating high statistical probabilities

We can analyze Visualizations using 3 questions:
     What data dose the user see?
          What are the inputs
          how was the data been processed?
     Why would someone use this tool?
          What is the purpose of the visualization?
          Why did the designer choose to show this information?
     How has the Visualization been designed?
          Check powerpoint

Video Notes:
     What data did you see?
          We see that there was lots of geospatial data
          Spatiotemporal data - data over time
          Paths start and end
          Transactions of good and services
          Speeds
          Number/Intensity

     Why would someone use this tool?
          To make it visible
          Look for patterns
          Advertise/Show what might not be obvious
          Simplified
          Visually stimulating, engaging
          *Implicit Comparison*
          Tracking

     How was the visualization designed?
          Location/Data/Perspective
          Size
          Color/Categories
          Motion/Animation
          Time
          Music

     What:
          Gap-minder World Map 2010
          Shows the population size and income of different countries
          Shows the life expectancy
          Colors in each country to identify its region
     Why:
          To show differences between regions of the rich and wealthy vs the poor and sick
          To show there is no correlation between pop size and country wealth/healthiness
          Which countries/regions have the most of wealth
     How:
          Color coded x-y axis - by region
          Labeled each country
          Different sizes relating to pop size
          Organized by income x-axis
          Organized by life expectancy/health on the y-axis
