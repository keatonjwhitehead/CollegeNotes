Week Six Discussion

Scatterplots: Tasks, Data, and Designs
Notes:
     Scatterplots are the most common methods for exploring and presenting data.
     Focus on the trade-offs of task affordances.
     "Take both task and data characteristics into account for prescriptive scatter
     plot design"
          Expect to identify areas of the scatterplot design space that is under-explored
          and provide guidance for effective scatterplot design, given the required
          affordances and relevant characteristics of the data.

     "Different design decisions can affect task performance, dependent on characteristics
     of the data."

     "identify good starting designs, as well as used in visualization authoring programs
     for both practitioners and people new to visualization design."

A Multi-level Typology of Abstract Visualization Tasks
Notes:
     Focus on low-level tasks or interactions and high-level tasks and leaving
     a gap between them that is not addressed.
     This leads to lack of distinction between the ends and means of a task, limiting
     the potential for rigorous analysis.
     Multi-level typology of visualization tasks to address this gap
          Why and how a visualization task is performed, and what the inputs and outputs
          are.
     Provides Abstract rather than domain-specific descriptions of tasks, so that useful
     comparisons can be made between visualization systems target at different application
     domains.

A Design Space of Visualization Tasks
Notes:
     Knowledge about visualization tasks plays an important role in choosing or building
     suitable visual representations to pursue them.

     Why is the task pursued? This specifies the task's goal
     How is a task carried out? This specifies the task's means
     What does a task seek> This specifies the data characteristics
     Where in the data does a task operate? This specifies the target, as well as
     the cardinality of data entries within that target.
     When is a task performed? This specifies the order of tasks
     Who is executing a task? This specifies the (type of) user.

     Goal
          Defines the intent with which the task is pursued.
          Three high-level goals:
               Exploratory analysis:
                    concerned with deriving hypotheses from an unknown dataset.
                    It is often equated with an undirected search

               Confirmatory analysis:
                    aims to test found or assumed hypotheses about a dataset. In
                    analogy to an undirected search, it is sometimes described as
                    a direct search

               Presentation:
                    deals with describing and exhibiting confirmed analysis results

          The Design space as a whole:
               Design dimensions do not stand for themselves, but are used in conjunction
               forming the design space.


               For this assignment I chose to read A Design space of Visualization
               Tasks and Scatterplots: Tasks, Data and Designs. In the Design space
               reading it defined the design space with 5-dimensions: goal, means,
               characteristics, target, and cardinality.  If I were to look at the
               Data that we pulled of Home Depot's stock prices and Apple stock prices
               it would have a design space that would look like {compare, search,
               correlation, attributes(Year and stock price), all}. This 5-dimensionality
               makes it very easy to think to change the different dimensions to
               find what you are looking for. As data can most of the time seem
               overwhelming and non-correlated having these tools help to simplify
               the data and find hidden meanings that aren't noticeable at first.

               The Scatterplot paper talked about how frequent scatterplots are
               used and how the way the data is displayed can really change the
               representation of the data.
