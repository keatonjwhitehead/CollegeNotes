Data Mining
////////////////////////
Why Data Mining?
     Data Explosion
          Storage is cheap so companies and people have been uploading more and more
          data
          We are drowning in data, we need to find something interesting in this data
          We need to automate analysis of massive data sets -> Data Mining

Who needs it?
     Science
          astronomy
          bioinformatics
          drug discovery
     Business
          fraud detection
          targeted marketing
     Web
          search engines
          advertising
     Government
          surveillance
          crime detection

What questions would you mine?
     Market Basket analysis
     Cluster analysis, Classification
     Time Series

Look into Project Epic
     Disaster data tracking
     Help with first responders

Data Mining = knowledge discovery from data (KDD)
     Extraction of interesting patterns or knowledge from huge amounts of Data
     What makes a pattern interesting?
          Correlations
     What is the value?
          Data itself is not useful, we need the knowledge of the pattern and apply
          that information to make predictions

Database Processing vs. Data Mining Processing
     Database Processing
          When you know exactly what your are looking for
          Query
               SQL
          Data
               Operational Data
          Output

     Mining Processing
          When you vaguely know what you are looking for
          Query
               No precise query language
          Data
               Transformed data
          Output
NBA
     Play-by-play information recorded by teams
          Who is on the court
          Who shoots
          Results
               These are all Database

     Coaches want to know what works best
          Plays that work well against a given teams
          Good/bad player matchups
               These are all Data mining we have to do more finagling to answer these
               days

Verizon
     Attrition rate around 25-30% a year!
     Task:     Predict who is likely to attrite next month
          Estimate customer value
          And what is the most cost-effective offer to be made to this customer

     Verizon Wireless built a customer data warehouse
     Identifies potential attriters
     Developed miltiple regional models
     Targeted customers and evaluated their value
     If they were worth keeping then offer them a discount
