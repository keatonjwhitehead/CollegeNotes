Data Mining
Class notes
/////////////////////////////
Are the patterns interesting?
     Interesting patterns
          Valid on new/test data with some certainty
          Novel
          potentially useful
          Ultimately understandable by humans

     Are all mined knowledge interesting?
     Objective measures
     Subjective measures
     Completeness, exclusiveness

Techniques utilized
     Data-intensive
     Data warehouse (OLAP)
     Machine learning
     Statistics
     Pattern recognition
     Visualization
     High-performance, etc.

Data mining and society
     Social impacts of data mining
     Privacy-preserving data mining
     Invisible data mining

Chapter 2: Data
     How did Target figure out a teen was pregnant before her father did?
     What data did they need to collect?
     How would they need to maintain the data?
     What did they need to do first to be able to predict a pregnancy?
     What did they need to do to determine the approximate due date?

     Types of Data Sets: Record data
          Relational records
               It is like excel where there are tables that can connect

          Transaction data
               Beer and diapers

          Document data
               Term-frequency vector (matrix) of text documents

          Transportation net
          World Wide Web
          Social connections
               Facebook

          Generic graph and html links
          Sequential Data
               Transaction sequences

     Data set: a grouped set of data objects
          Students courses, customers, products

     Attribute
          A data field, representing a characteristic or feature of a data object
     Types:
          Nominal - categories, states
               hair color, major, occupation
          Binary - boolean, symmetric or asymmetric
               Smoker, graduated
          Ordinal
               Freshman, sophmore, Junior, Senior
          Numeric - quantitative
               interval-scaled: 100 C is interval scales, year 2000 or 2018
               Ratio-scaled: 100 k is ratio scaled since it is twice as high as 50 K

          Binary
               Two states:
                    Symmetric binary: both outcomes equally important
                         smoker graduated
                    Asymmetric binary: outcomes not equally important
                         Medical Test
                         Convention: assign 1 to most important outcome
          Ordinal
               Values have a meaningful order (ranking) but magnitude between successive
               intervals
                    Positions in the Military

          Discrete Attribute
               Has only a finite or countably infinite set of Values
                    Zip code, profession
