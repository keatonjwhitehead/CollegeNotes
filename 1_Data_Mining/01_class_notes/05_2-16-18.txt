Data Mining
Class Notes
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Frequent Pattern Mining
     Challenges
          Multiple scans of the whole data set
          A huge number of candidates
          Tedious support  counting for candidates

     Improving Apriori: general ideas
          Partitioning
          Sampling
          Transaction Reduction
          Hash-based Technique
          Dynamic  Itemset Counting
          Counting Support of Candidates using Hash Tree

     ECLAT (Equivalence Class Transformation)
     Horizontal data format
          T1: {a,b,c,d}
     Vertical data format
          t(ae) = {T1,T2,T3}
     Derive closed pattern via vertical intersection
          t(x) = {T1, T2, T3} and t(Y) = {T1,T3,T4}}
          t(xy) = {T1,T3}

     FP-tree Construction
          Step 1: Scan (find Frequency 1-itemset)
          Step 2: Sort Frequency items in descending frequency
          Step 3: Scan construct FP-tree
