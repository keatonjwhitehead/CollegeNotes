Data Mining - Chapter 1
///////////////////////
Example: A Web mining Framework
     Web mining usually involves
          Data cleaning
          Data integration from multiple sources
          Warehousing the datasetsData cube construction
          Data selection for data MiningData mining presentation of the mining results
          Patterns and knowledge to be used or stored into knowledge-base

KDD process: A View from ML and statistics
     Data Pre-processing
          Data integration
          Normalization
          Feature selection
          Dimension reduction
     Data Mining
          Pattern discovery
          Classification
          Outlier analysis
     Post-Processing
          Pattern evaluation
          Pattern selection
          Pattern interpretation
          Pattern visualization
Data Mining vs. Data Exploration
     Business intelligence View
          Warehouse, data cube, reporting but not much Mining
     Business objects vs. Data mining tools

Data Mining Views
     Data View
          Stock data
          transaction data
          location
          basic text/video/sound
          traffic
     Knowledge view
          What are we trying to figure out?
          What is the question we wish to ask?
     Method view
          What methods will you use?
     Application view
          How would you apply that knowledge?
               Beer and Dipper?
          Target applied their knowledge of the 16 year old that was pregnant

Multi-dimensional view of Data mining
     Data to be mined
          database data
          Data Warehouse
          Transactional data
               Target data -> Which checkout is used the most
          Sequence
               bought a printer -> Ill need ink/paper in a month
          Data streams
          Sensor data
          Spatiotemporal
          Time-series
          text and Web
               Web has hyperlinks -> Topic detection
               Similarity and popularity
                    -> Page Rank
          Multi-media
          Graphs
               Who is a social leader
          Social and information networks

     Knowledge to be mined (data mining functions)
          Similarity
               Characterization
                    Customers who spent $1000 a year
                         age 40
                         employed
                         good credit score
          Different
               Discrimination
                    Frequent vs. infrequent Customers
                         age, education, employed
                    Dry vs. wet regions
                         precipitation, temperature, humidity
          Frequent Patterns   What items are frequently purchased together in your Walmart?
               Frequent item-sets
                    milk, bread
                    beer, diaper
               Frequent sequences
                    printer, toner
                    dinner, movie
               Frequent structures
                    Big graphs that can end up in different structures
                         A leader vs someone who is connected to everyone

          Associations
               Association analysis
                    buys milk => buys bread
                    support = 0.5% confidence = 75%
                         support - the transaction where they contain both
                         confidence - how often is one bought after the other?
                    Support


          Classification and Prediction
               1310 DNA comparison Example
               Finding a model that describes and distinguishes data classes or concepts
               Based on training datasetsUse classifications to predict unknown
               class labels
               Methods
                    IF-THEN rules, decision tree, neural network, logistic regression,
                    support vector machines

          Clustering
               Unsupervised learning
               Group data to form new categories
                    cluster houses to find distribution Patterns
               Principle
                    Maximizing intra-class similarity

          Outlier analysis
               Outlier: A data objet that does not comply with the general behavior
               of the data.

          Marketing analysis
               Data sources: credit card transactions, club cards, customer calls,
               lifestyle.
               Target marketing:
                    Finding your specific audience that wants your products
