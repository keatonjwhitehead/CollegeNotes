Multi-level association rules
     Milk => wheat bread [8%,70%]
          70% of the purchases that had milk had wheat bread
     Skim milk => wheat bread [3%, 72%]
          Support of 3% and 72% of the purchases with skim milk had wheat bread

     Support
          Uniform Support
               Still have to have the minimum support

          Reduced support
               As we go into more specificity we lower the threshold to find frequency
               of a lower support purchase

     Multi-dimensional Association
          Single-dimensional (intra-dimensional) rules:
               buys(X, "milk") => buys(x, "Milk")

          Multi-dimensional rules: >= 2 predicates
               Inter-dimensional


     Categorical vs Quantitative
          Categorical attributes
               nominal, finite number of possible values, no ordering among values
               occupation. brand, color
               approaches: data cube

          Quantitative attributes
               numeric implicit ordering among values
               age, income, price
               approaches: discretization, clustering, gradient

     Static
          redefining what our bins are

     Dynamic discretization

Negative and Rare Patterns
     Rare patterns
          Very low support but interesting
          Rare and interesting items

     Negative patterns
          if one goes up the other goes down

     Negatively correlated patterns can be more interesting than frequent patterns

Constraint-Based Mining
     Automatically find all patterns in a data set
          Unrealistic@ too many patterns, not focused

     Data mining should be an interactive process

     Constraint-based mining
          user flexibility
          system optimization

Constraints in Data Mining
     Differnet types of Constraints
          Knowledge type constraint
          Data constraint
          Dimension/level constraint
               What level do you want to dive into? did they buy mild then bread
               and a specific brand?
          Rule (or Pattern) constraint

          Interesting constraint

Meta-Rule Guided Mining
     Meta-rule can be in the rule form with partially instantiated predicates and constants
     age(X, "15-25") ^ profession(X,"student") => buys(X,"iPad")

Constraint properties
     Antimonotonic 
          if an itemset S violates the constraint so does all of its supersets

     monotonic
          if an itemset S satisfies the constraint
     succinct
          Enumerate all and only those sets that are guaranteed to satisfy the constraint

     convertible
          Conver tough constraints into anti-monotonic or monotonic by properly odering
          items

     inconvertible
