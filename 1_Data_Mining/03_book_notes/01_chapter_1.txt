1.1 Why Data Mining?

     1.3 What kinds of Data can be Mined?

          Data mining can only be applied if the data is meaningful for a target
          application

          The most common forms are:
               database data
               data warehouse data
               transactional data.

          1.3.1 Database Data
               *Database system = Database management system (DBMS)*
                    consists of interrelated data, known as a database
                         A set of software programs to manage and access the data.
                         These programs provide mechanisms for defining database
                         structures and data Storage;
                              managing concurrent, shared, or distributed data access
                              to ensure consistency and security of the information
                              stored despite crashes or attempts at unauthorized access
               *Relational Database* is a collection of *tables*
                    assigned with a unique name
                    consists of a set of *attributes* (columns or fields)
                    stores a large set of *tuples* (records or rows)
                         tuples represent an object identified by a unique key and
                         described by a set of attribute values

               *entity-relationship(ER)*
                    often constructed for relational databases
                    represents the database as a set entities and their relationships

               Example ALLElectronics:
                    customer  (cust ID, name, address, age, occupation, annual income, credit information, category, . . . )
                    item      (item ID, brand, category, type, price, place made, supplier, cost, . . . )
                    employee  (empl ID, name, category, group, salary, commission, . . . )
                    branch    (branch ID, name, address, . . . )
                    purchases (trans ID, cust ID, empl ID, date, time, method paid, amount) (trans ID, item ID, qty)
                    works_at  (empl ID, branch ID)

          1.3.2 Data Warehouse
                    *Data Warehouse* is a repository of information collected from
                    multiple sources, stored under a unified schema, and usually
                    residing at a single site.

                    Usually modeled by a multidimensional data structure, called a *data cube*
                         Each dimension corresponds to an attribute or a set of
                         attributes in the schema
                         Each cell stores the value of some aggregate measure such as count

                    *Drill-down*
                         drill down the sales data summarized by quarter to see data
                         summarized by month

                    *Roll-up*
                         roll up sales data summarized by city to view data summarized
                         by country

                    Data cube
                         (a) showing summarized data
                         (b) showing summarized data resulting from drill-down and
                             roll-up operations on the cube in (a)
                         For readability, only some of the cube cell values are shown


          1.3.3 Transactional Data
               *Transaction database* captures a transaction, such as a customer's
               purchase, flight booking, etc
               Typically includes a unique transaction identity number and a list
               of the *items* making up the transaction
                    may include item descriptions, information about the salesperson
                    or the branch

               Stored in a table, with one record per transaction
               Can track what items are sold good together by mining for frequent
               itemsets

     1.4 What kinds of Patterns can be Mined
          *Data mining functionalities*
               characterization
               discrimination
               frequent Patterns
               associations
               correlations
               classification
               regression
               clustering analysis
               outlier analysis

               Are used to specify the kinds of patterns to be found in data mining tasks
                    *descriptive*
                         tasks characterization properties of the data in a target
                         data set
                    *predictive*
                         perform induction on the current data in order to make
                         predictions

          1.4.1 Class/Concept Description: Characterization and Discrimination

               classes of items for sale - computers, printers
               concepts of customers - bigSpenders, budgetSpenders
                    Can be derived with:
                         (1) data characterization, by summarizing the data of the
                         data of the class under study in general terms - *target class*
                         (2) data discrimination, by comparison of the target class with
                         one or a set of comparative classes - *contrasting classes*
                         (3) both data characterization and Discrimination

               *Data characterization*
                    summarization of the general characteristics of features of a
                    target class of data
                    The data corresponding to the user-specified class are typically
                    collected by a query

                    The output of data characterization
                         pie charts, bar charts, curves, multidimensional data cubes,
                         multidimensional tables
                    The resulting descriptions can also be presented as *generalized relations*
                    or in rule form - *characteristic rules*

                    *Data discrimination*
                         comparison of the general features of the target class data
                         objects against the general features of objects from one or multiple
                         contrasting classes

          1.4.2 Mining Frequent Patterns, Associations, and Correlations
               *Frequent Patterns*
                    Patterns that occur frequently in database
                    Milk and Bread

               *Association analysis*
                    *Multidimensional association rule* example:
                         "    buys(X,“computer”) ⇒ buys(X,“software”) [support = 1%,confidence = 50%],
                         where X is a variable representing a customer. A *confidence*,
                         or certainty, of 50% means that if a customer buys a computer,
                         there is a 50% chance that she will buy software as well.
                         A 1% *support* means that 1% of all the transactions under
                         analysis show that computer and software are purchased together.
                         This association rule involves a single attribute or predicate
                         (i.e., buys) that repeats. Association rules that contain a
                         single predicate are referred to as *single-dimensional association*
                         rules. Dropping the predicate notation, the rule can be written
                         simply as “computer ⇒ software [1%, 50%].”
                         Suppose, instead, that we are given the AllElectronics relational
                         database related to purchases. A data mining system may find
                         association rules like
                              age(X , “20..29”) ∧ income(X , “40K..49K”) ⇒ buys(X , “laptop”) [support = 2%, confidence = 60%]."

                         Usually not interesting if they do not satisfy both a *minimum
                         support threshold* and a *minimum confidence threshold*
                              Analysis can be performed to uncover interesting statistical
                              *correlations* between associated attribute-value pairs
