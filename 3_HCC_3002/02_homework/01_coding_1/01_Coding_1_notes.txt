     that are in your physical surroundings, nothing digital.

Criteria
     Affordance
     Mental Model

     ~For each example you found, take a photo or a short video to demonstrate the observed usability
     issue.
     ~Indicate the location you found this artifact, including a description and GPS coordinate
     ~Finally, write a paragraph to make your argument why there exists a usability
     issue and then propose your solution to improve it.
