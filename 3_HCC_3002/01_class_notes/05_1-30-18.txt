People should be afraid of AI

     For:
          Unknown - They can grow and learn much faster than us and surpass us
                    They could take control over our economy
          Surveillance - What pricy rights would we have if AI controls everything?
          Who? - Who gets to control the AI?
          Unemployment - People will lose their jobs
          Misuse - People can misuse it
          Dangerous - Several deaths with driving cars
          Privacy -

     Against:
          Adherence
          Benefits - Space exploration
          Accuracy - Sort more data more accurately
          Useful - provide things that are helpful
          Access - People have equal access to knowledge as AI gets smart so will humans
          Task -
          Freedom -
          Intelligence -
          Perspective - There are too many issues that AI could help to not use

Why did Google beat AltaVista?
     Simpler user interface
     Allows users to specify sophisticated queries to express exactly what they want to find
     It pays less attention to the content of the page than to the context of the page

How do people search?
     In-home interviews and observations

Findings: Nine major types
     1 - Power searcher: exact phrase, boolean search
     2 - Developing searcher: learn how to search
     3 - Social searcher: search together with others
     4 - Domain-specific searcher: know particular sites well
     5 - Rule-bound searcher: repeating similar search approaches
     6 - Visual searcher: use images
     7 - Disinterested searcher: reluctant
     8 - Efficient searcher:
     9 - Interest-driven searcher:

Implications
     Adaptive search options that support switching search modes

     Power vs. rule-bound
          Who is open to learning new search strategies? (Power)
          Who is reluctant to change their strategies (Rule-bound)

Limitations
     *Participant bias*: subjects may try to make the experimenters happy
     *Self-selection bias:* Subjects volunteered to participate; How about those who didn't?
          US participants only

Guidelines
     Q: How good is the current search UI?
     A: Run usability testing

     Q: How

Seven factors:
     Informativeness
     Understandability
     Confusion
     Distraction
     Readability
     Information Density
     Accessibility
