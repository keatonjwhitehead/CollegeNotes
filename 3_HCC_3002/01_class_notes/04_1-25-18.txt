AI: Search

     Brief History
          Archie(1993)
               Few hundred web sites
               Retrieve file names matching a user query

          Excite(1993)
               Created by six Stanford undergrad students
               Use statistical analysis of word relationships to produce more relevant
               results

               TFIDF
                    Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency
                         How do we compare two different documents with similar content?
                    The higher frequency of a document with relevant queried text
                    means it is more relevant and will be more useful for the user

          Yahoo(1994)
               Started off as a directory
               You had to pay to be on their directory


          AltaVista(1995)
               Build an advance query


          Google(1998)
               Founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin
               PageRank algorithm
                    Using links
               Users have freedom to express complex queries
               Search isn't what is inside each document rather it will be based
               on the links within the website

               Provided search results for Yahoo

     Why AltaVista shut down
          User Experience
               Google had:
                    Simple UI

          Speed
               Tells you how quickly a search was performed
               Easy Queries + Fast Search results
                    Allowed users to quickly fine tune their search to find what
                    they were looking for

     Today: Many new HCI issues about search

     User Goals

          to be addressed in order to achieve a high level of usability.

          Tell me -> Show me -> involve me

          Catering for these needs and enabling access to the product of system
          for a s many people as it is the aim of inclusive design.
