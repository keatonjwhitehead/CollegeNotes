HCI
/////////////////////////////////
Eigen Faces
     Instead of representing your face in a linear fashion but rather a collection
     of vectors and compare that to other photos
     It is a linear combination that helps determine the similarities
     This allows you to just provide a photo and you don't need to input data points

Face Images in the Feret Database
     Doesn't capture variation of each face. this simply just captures a 180 degree
     capture of the subjects Face

The Five
     Affordance/Signifiers
     Mental Model
     Mapping
     Feedback
     Visible System Status

     Affordance
          ~What can I do with this (based on its design characteristics alone)?
          ~The design tells you what do with it with out needing a label.
          ~Door handle example - at a height that it is use to for your hands, the
          gap is only able to fit your fingers in

     Signifiers
          ~A label that provides extra information on how to use object
          ~Door handle example - a pull/push sign to tell the user what to do

     Natural Affordance vs. Signifiers
          ~Having a label is often a telling story sign that the natural affordance
          of an object is not sufficient to convey to users what they can do with the object

     Mental Model
          ~How does this work?
          ~A user may be wondering:
               Does it open at all?
               Does it open inward or outward?
               Which side should I pull or push?
          ~A user thinks "how does it work?"
               Hint: hinges

          ~A user's mental model, the belief of how things works (the internal mechanism of the hinges)
          ~It can help the user reason and infer the affordance of an object (I can probably pull here) and the expected outcome (The door will then open).

          ~Make predictions
               What will happen if I do this?
          ~Troubleshoot
               What may be the reason something is not working?
               What can I do to resolve this?

          Definition:
               ~Based on belief, not facts
               ~It is the model of what users' know about a system such as a website
               ~They base their predictions about the system on their mental models
               and thus plan their future actions based on how that model predicts the appropriate
               course.
               ~Individual users each have their own mental model.
               ~One big dilemma is the common gap between designer' and users' mental
               models

     Feedback
          ~How does the system know it receives my input?
          ~Light flashing because user inputed
          ~Low battery light blinking

     Feedback vs System Status
          ~Feedback
               Response to users' conscious input actions
               otherwise users may not be sure the system received their inputs

          ~System Status
               Notify users what changes may have happened

Affordance
     Is there any design characteristics

Mental model
     How does Face ID work?
          Does it work for multiple users?
          Does the performance improve over time?
          Can I transfer my data with my face?
          Would the face ID work in the dark?
          Does it work with face of colors?
          Does it work if I am further or closer to the device
