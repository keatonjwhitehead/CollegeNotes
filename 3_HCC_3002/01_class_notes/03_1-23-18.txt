Material Design Principles
     Material is the metaphor
     Bold, Graphic, intentional
     Motion provides meaning

Guideline on Help & Feedback
     Immediate access
          Take the user directly to help content upon selecting "Help" in your app

Do you really want your faces tagged automatically?
     Problem:
          How can users specify their tagging preferences?
          How can a system respect that?

     Scenario:
          A photo with three people: Ben, Jason, and Ken. Jason doesn't want his photo
          tagged. But Ben and Jason are okay with it.

     Solution:
          Use location of each "subject" that person's preference profile
